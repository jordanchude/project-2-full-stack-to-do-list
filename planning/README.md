## Project Description

For my unit 02 project, I am going to create a to-do list tracker for a company and its employees. For the frontend, components include a responsive navigation bar, a static header/jumbotron that stays the same for every user request and promotes the app, and section that shows each employee's photo, name, and to-dos, and a footer for general company information. 

## User Stories
**Users are able to...**
- Use a responsive navigation bar on desktop, tablet, and mobile to navigate to the to-do list section and the top of the page.
- Scroll down to each added employee and their corresponding to-do list to stay updated on any changes.
- Press a call-to-action button under the header/jumbotron to add an employee card with their name, title, photo for the top of their to-do list, and to-do list items.
- Press an edit button on each created card to edit the name, photo, title, and/or to-do list to reflect any to-do list, title, name, or preferred photo updates.
- Press a delete button on each created card to remove a card when an employee is terminated.
